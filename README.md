# Index to Rabbi J. David Bleich's Writings
Using JSONS from Sefaria.org, I wrote a small tool to extract the chapter subheadings in effort towards producing a more helpful index. At the given time, it's too challenging to find specific articles without browing through all the volumes in print or online. This makes it a little easier. 
See the `tocs` folder for the output.
